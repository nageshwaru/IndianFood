        <h1>Chapter 10: Punjabi Chole Masala</h1>
        <p>This Punjabi Chana Masala or Chole Masala is an authentic North Indian style Chickpea Curry made with white chickpeas, freshly powdered spices, onions, tomatoes and herbs.</p>
        <p>Chana masala is a naturally vegan recipe with added health benefits of the chickpeas which are packed full of protein, minerals and fiber.</p>
        <p>In this post, I am sharing 2 super delicious chana masala recipes.</p>
        <p><b>Authentic Punjabi Chana Masala</b> – Made in a pan on the stovetop with freshly ground spices.</p>
        <p><b>Instant Pot Chana Masala (Home Style)</b> – One pot, super easy and don't require the special chana masala spice blend or powder.</p>
        <h2>What is Chana Masala?</h2>
        <p>Chana Masala is a popular Indian dish of white chickpeas in a spicy and tangy gravy. In North India, chana masala is called as ‘chole masala’ or simply ‘chole’.</p>
        <p>Both the words “Chana” and “Chole” refer to chickpeas. <br />In Hindi language, the word “Masala” means a mixture of spices. In chana masala – specifically the word ‘masala’ means a mixture of ground spices.</p>
        <p>There are many variations of making chana masala, but I like the Punjabi chana recipe shared here the most.</p>
        <h2>About Chole Masala Recipe</h2>
        <p>This chana masala recipe reminds me of Chole Bhature, which is our favorite dish. Chole Bhature is a Punjabi chickpea curry dish that is served with a fried leavened puffed bread known as “Bhature”.</p>
        <p>It tastes exactly like the North Indian street side chickpea curry, minus the heat, since we don’t prefer our food to be too spicy.</p>
        <p>However if you prefer spicier food, increase the quantity of red chili powder, green chillies and garam masala powder to get the extra spice and heat.</p>

        <h2>Soaking Chickpeas</h2>
        <p>While making any chickpea or Rajma (Kidney Bean Curry), it is always better to soak the chickpeas overnight or at least for 8 hours as then it is easier to cook them.</p>
        <p>Soaking beans or chickpeas reduce the phytic acid which causes bloating and flatulence. I would always suggest to soak chickpeas and not directly cook the dried chickpeas.</p>
        <p>Soaking also reduces the cooking time and ensures that the chickpeas are really softened well. This not only gives a good texture but the chickpeas also become easy to digest.</p>
        <h3>Tips &amp; Substitutes</h3>
        <p><b>Dried Amla (Dried Indian Gooseberry) and Dry Pomegranate Seeds:</b> </p>
        <p>The dried amla gives a dark color to the chole, along with a light tang. The pomegranate seeds give a sour taste. Find these ingredients at Indian specialty food stores or online at amazon.com.</p>
        <p>If you cannot find these ingredients, add dry mango powder (amchur powder) towards the end. In the absence of amchur powder, you can also squeeze some lime juice towards the end.</p>
        <p>You can also use a black tea bag to achieve the darker color. If you are not fussy about the dark color, then just cook the chickpeas in water with some salt.</p>
        <p><b>Chana Masala Spices:</b> </p>
        <p>What contributes to the flavors and aroma of this dish are the freshly ground chole masala spices. The whole spices are roasted until they get extra browned and are later ground. This chole masala spice powder is then blended with a sautéed onion-ginger-tomato mixture that makes the chickpea curry more flavorful.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Serving Suggestions for Chana Masala</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">As I have explained earlier, I prefer my chana masala served with a poori or roti . Some great options are: tandoori roti, phulka, kulcha, bhatura or naan.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Add some sliced onions and lime and you have the perfect Indian snack. This chana masala also tastes good with plain rice or jeera rice.</p>
        <h2>How to make Chana Masala?</h2>
        <p>For ease of understanding, I have divided this post into 3 steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Step 1</b> – Soaking and cooking chickpeas.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Step 2</b> – Roasting spices to make chana masala powder.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Step 3</b> – Making chana gravy.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 1 – Soaking and Pressure Cooking Chickpeas</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Wash and soak 1 cup chickpeas (chana or chole) in enough water overnight. Add enough water to the chickpeas to increase in size during soaking. Rinse the soaked chickpeas in water. Rinsed and soaked chickpeas pictured below.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To give a dark color to the chickpeas, traditionally dried amla (Indian gooseberries) are added. These also give a faint sourness to the stock. If you do not have dried amla, then add 1 black tea bag. If you do not care about the dark color, then you can also just cook the chickpeas with salt and water.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/chanamasala_chickpeasamla.png" style="width: 310px;height: 205px;" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In a pressure cooker add the chickpeas along with the 2 to 3 dried amla pieces or 1 black tea bag. Taj tea bags work very well. Then pour in 2.5 to 3 cups water.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Season with ½ tsp salt. Stir very well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pressure cook the chickpeas for 12 to 15 whistles. The chickpeas should be cooked well and softened. The chickpeas should be soft when you mash it with a spoon. The chickpeas should not give you a bite when you eat it. If you don't have a pressure cooker, then cook the chickpeas in a pot with plenty of water. Depending on the quality of chickpeas, it can take less or more time.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step 2 – Making Chole Masala Powder</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, in a pan, take all the whole spices for the chole masala and on a low heat begin to roast them. The spices used for masala are the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>2 black cardamoms</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>1 inch cinnamon</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>3 to 4 peppercorns</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>2 cloves</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>1 medium tej patta (Indian bay leaf)or 2 small tej patta</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>¼ tsp carom seeds (ajwain)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>1 tsp cumin seeds</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>1 tsp coriander seeds</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>1 tsp fennel seeds</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>½ tsp dry pomegranate seeds</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>1 or 2 dry red chilies</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/chanamasala_ingredients.png" style="width: 309px;height: 204px;" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Stir often and roast the spices until they get extra browned. Don’t burn them, but you have to go beyond a normal roasting point with them. Don’t stop even after they become fragrant, as they need to get more browned than usual.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The extra browned and roasted spices are pictured below.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/chanamasala_extrabrownedroastedspices.png" style="width: 313px;height: 207px;" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Let these roasted spices cool and then grind them finely in a coffee grinder or in a dry grinder.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/chanamasala_roastedspices.png" style="width: 316px;height: 207px;" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>By now the chickpeas are cooked (pictured below). You will see a darker brown shade in the white chickpeas. Remove the amla pieces, which would have softened by now, or the tea bag from the stock and discard them.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/chanamasala_cookedchickpeas.png" style="width: 322px;height: 211px;" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step 3 – Making Chana Masala Gravy</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Heat 1.5 to 2 tbsp oil in a pan or kadai. Add ½ tsp ginger-garlic paste and sauté until their raw aroma goes away.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Then add 1 medium sized finely chopped onion and saute till the onions turn  light brown.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add 1 medium sized finely chopped tomato.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sauté the tomatoes until they soften and the oil starts to leave aside of the masala.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Then add the powdered spices that we made, along with ½ teaspoon red chili powder and ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/chanamasala_powderedspices.png" style="width: 327px;height: 218px;" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stir well. Then add 2 to 3 slit green chilies to the onion-ginger-tomato mixture.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the cooked &amp; drained chickpeas. Reserve the stock.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Mix very well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Season with salt as per requirement. Mix again. Keep the addition of salt in check as salt is also there in the stock.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add about 1 to 1.25 cups of the reserved stock or water. Stir well.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/chanamasala_addwater.png" style="width: 303px;height: 199px;" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Cover and simmer on a low to medium flame. You can also cook chickpeas without the lid. The gravy will thicken and reduce. Mash a few chickpeas. This will help thicken the chickpea curry. You can keep the consistency you prefer. At home, we prefer chole with a bit of gravy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you have not added dry pomegranate seeds while roasting the spices, then you need to add amchur powder (dry mango powder) now. About 1 teaspoon amchur powder is enough. However, you can add less or more of it as per your taste. Stir the gravy very well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The chana masala is ready to be served.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/chanamasala.png" style="width: 328px;height: 215px;" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Garnish with chopped onions and cilantro (coriander leaves). Serve the Punjabi chole with a fried Indian breads like bhatura or poori, along with sliced onions, ginger julienne and lime wedges. This chickpea curry also tastes good with plain rice or cumin rice.</p>
                <p>
