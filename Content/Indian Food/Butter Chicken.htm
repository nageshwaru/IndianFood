        <p>Every celebratory occasion in the family, butter chicken made an appearance on the dinner table. I would grunt and nag mom for preferring him more than me—but all of us knew that was all a façade because I would always end up wiping the plate clean.</p>
        <h2><u>What Is Butter Chicken?</u>
        </h2>
        <p>Butter chicken is prepared with marinated chicken that's first grilled and then served in a rich gravy (a.k.a. curry) made with tomato, butter, and a special spice blend as a base.</p>
        <p>Unlike most Indian curries where the preparation of the base starts with a blend of onion and a ginger garlic paste cooked in oil, butter chicken uses tomato as a base and is cooked in butter, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. Cashews and almonds add to the sweetness and richness of the dish.</p>

        <h2><u>The History of Butter Chicken</u>
        </h2>
        <p>The roots of butter chicken are only as recent as the 1950s, when it was developed accidentally by the chef of famous restaurant Moti Mahal in Delhi, the capital of India. For chef Kundan Lal Gujral, it was a common practice to throw in butter, tomatoes, and leftover tandoori chicken into a pot to make use of the leftovers.</p>
        <p>Little did he know that this dish would become their best seller and put them on the map. </p>
        <p>Now the recipe is adapted by restaurants across the world, though it's really a “special occasion” dish in Indian homes.</p>

        <h2><u>Butter Chicken vs. Chicken Tikka Masala</u>
        </h2>
        <p>Some people get confused between butter chicken and <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/chicken_tikka_masala/">chicken tikka masala</a>. The two might look and taste similar to some, too. The main difference is in the preparation.</p>
        <p>Butter chicken uses a lot of butter (makhan in Hindi) while chicken tikka masala uses tikka masala (a spice blend) comprised of coriander, paprika, black and green cardamom, cinnamon, and turmeric. Butter chicken is sweeter and chicken tikka masala is spicier.</p>
        <p>Even more importantly, butter chicken originated in India, while Chicken Tikka Masala was invented in the United Kingdom—it’s the national dish!

        <h2><u>The Spices for Butter Chicken</u>
        </h2>
        <p><b>Kashmiri Lal Mirch</b>: Butter chicken gets its bright color and its name from Kashmiri Lal Mirch, a variety of red chile from the northern region of Kashmir. I usually buy mine from our local Indian store but online retailers carry great varieties, too. (To cheat, though, if you can't find this spice, add a couple drops of red food coloring to brighten up the dish.)</p>
        <p><b>Ginger Garlic Paste</b>: Traditionally, freshly grated ginger and garlic are used for the paste but if you’d like to speed up the process you can also buy a jar of ginger garlic paste from a local specialty food store or order one online, such as Rani Ginger Garlic paste.</p>
        <p><b>Kasuri Methi</b>: The real unsung hero in this symphony of spices is kasuri methi, a variety of fenugreek leaves. It’s added to the dish in a very small amount, but its earthy flavor balances the richness of cream and the depth of spices used in the dish. Takes the dish to up to a whole different level.<br />If you have a local Indian grocery, it should carry this spice. These days, major supermarkets including Whole Foods and Safeway also carry it.</p>
        <h2><u>Authentic Indian Food at Home</u>
        </h2>
        <p>With this recipe, I have tried to stay as authentic as I can, while also keeping it simple enough that you could fix it for dinner tonight without breaking your back.</p>
        <p>Feel free to use just garam masala or even chicken tikka masala spice mix if you do not have all the spices for the marinade. You can even use paprika instead of Kashmiri Lal Mirch if you have trouble finding it, and can completely omit Kasuri Methi if you absolutely have to (but remember, it sure is the unsung hero!).</p>
        <p>I also used roasted canned tomatoes here to save the time of peeling whole tomatoes. Canned tomato also adds to the deep red color in the dish.</p>
        <h2><u>Make-Ahead Butter Chicken</u>
        </h2>
        <p>You can freeze this dish in an airtight covered container or a zip-top bag for a month. Thaw and reheat in a saucepan over medium-low heat to retain the texture.</p>

                    <br />Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Using your hands, massage the marinade into the chicken.<br />Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.</p>

                <p><b>Soak cashews and almonds: </b>
                    <br />Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight) before preparing the rest of the recipe.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Cook the chicken:</b>
                    <br />Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan.<br />Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). Do not crowd the pan. <br /><br />Once cooked, transfer the chicken into a separate dish. Cover and set aside for later.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Start making the sauce:
</b>
                    <br />Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat. As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes.

<br /><br />Stir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, until all the extra liquid is cooked off. The sauce should be a loose, paste-like consistency.

<br /><br />Add coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt. Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat.</p>

<br />As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes.</p>

        <h3><u>Tips</u>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Marination is the key to get flavorful,tender &amp; succulent pieced of chicken.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Yogurt in the marinade tenderizes the chicken so do not skip it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Makhani receipe never uses onion so is this butter chicken receipe. Using onion changes the taste of the dish.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The rich taste in the gravy comes from the cashews (or almonds) &amp; cream.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can make the gravy ahead and refrigerate. Just grill the marinated chicken when needed</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>And heat up the gravy. Then add the grilled chicken.</p>
