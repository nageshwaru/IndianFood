        <h2>What is Khaman</h2>
        <p>Khaman, also known as khaman dhokla in other Indian states, is a popular delicacy from the Gujarati cuisine.</p>
        <p>It is light, spongy and includes a hint of great savory flavor from a simple combination of gram flour (besan), spices, and herbs. Gram flour is ground skinned black chickpeas.</p>
        <p>Khaman is a healthy savory-sweet snack that happens to be vegan and gluten-free too, if you skip semolina and asafoetida in the batter.</p>
        <p>Khaman is also known as yellow dhokla as it has a yellow color or besan dhokla. It is also known as instant khaman.</p>
        <p>They’re perfect to enjoy for a hearty and satisfying breakfast or an afternoon or evening snack.</p>

        <h3>What is the Difference Between Dhokla and Khaman Dhokla?</h3>
        <p>Khaman is popularly referred to as khaman dhokla but in actuality, a dhokla is made differently than khaman.</p>
        <p>Dhokla is made with ground, fermented batter of rice and lentils like chana dal or urad dal. You can check my recipe for an authentic <a href="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/dhokla-recipe/">Dhokla</a> made with rice and chana dal.</p>
        <p>While khaman is made instantly with gram flour. Khaman batter is not fermented unlike a dhokla batter.</p>
        <p>In the taste department, fermentation gives dhokla a really complex flavorsome taste, but a khaman also tastes equally great.</p>
        <p>The color of dhokla can range from cream to light yellow or yellow but a khaman always has a bright yellow color.</p>
        <h3>Eno (Fruit Salt)</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/khamandhokla_fruitsalt.png" style="width: 342px;height: 227px;" />
        </p>
        <p>As a leavening agent, we use in this khaman recipe is fruit salt. Eno is a popular Indian brand of fruit salt that is used to relieve acidity and heartburn.</p>
        <p>Fruit salt is composed of citric acid, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), and sodium carbonate.</p>
        <p>Sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate are effervescent ingredients that bubble and release carbon dioxide when added to water.</p>
        <h3>Baking Soda or Eno</h3>
        <p>To make khaman, you can also use baking soda. But baking soda gives its soapy aroma if used in excess, so be careful not to add too much.</p>
        <p>Eno gives you a perfect fluffy and soft khaman while the one made with baking soda is not that fluffy or spongy.</p>
        <p>I personally prefer to use eno in khaman as it gives the best results. I do not favor baking soda, as firstly we cannot stand the soapy aroma and secondly the texture is not that airy or spongy in comparison to the khaman made with eno.</p>
        <p>Use eno that is fresh and within its shelf period. If your eno is not fresh or active, the texture of khaman will be flat and dense. And please do not use flavored eno – the regular eno without any flavor works the best.</p>
        <p>Both eno and baking soda react with turmeric powder and gives a red tinge or red spots in khaman dhokla. So add little turmeric powder or skip it completely.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Lemon Juice or Citric Acid</h3>
        <p> Citric acid gives a superb fluffy texture or lemon juice also works great, but citric acid wins here. That said, use whatever is easily available to you.</p>
        <p>To swap citric acid with lemon juice, use this standard proportion of:</p>
        <p><b>1 tablespoon lemon juice = ¼ teaspoon citric acid (in the powdered form)</b>
        </p>
        <p>For citric acid, use a food-grade and pure citric acid. I also suggest including freshly squeezed lemon juice. Use a fresh lemon.</p>
        <h2>How to make Khaman Dhokla</h2>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Grease a steamer pan with 2 to 3 teaspoons oil.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Take 1.5 cups gram flour (120 grams besan) in a mixing bowl or pan. Do use gram flour which has a fine texture.</p>
                <p><b>TIP</b>: You can make khaman with chickpea flour as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/khamandhokla_flour.png" style="width: 293px;height: 194px;" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The add the following ingredients:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>2 to 3 pinches of turmeric powder</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>a generous pinch of asafoetida (skip to make a gluten-free version)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>1.5 tablespoons lemon or lime juice or ⅓ to ½ teaspoon pure citric acid</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>1.5 teaspoons ginger paste (crush 1.5 inch ginger and 1.5 teaspoons green chilies in a mortar-pestle)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>1.5 teaspoons green chili paste</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>1 tablespoon sugar or add according to taste</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>1 teaspoon salt or add as per taste</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>TIP</b>: Avoid adding too much of turmeric powder as then the fruit salt or baking soda reacts with the turmeric powder and makes it red in color, thereby giving reddish dots, specks or tones in the khaman.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add 1 cup water (or more or less as needed) and 1 tablespoon oil to make a thick yet smooth flowing batter. The amount of water needed depends on the quality of flour, so start with 1 cup and add as required. Stir well to combine.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add 1 tablespoon rava (semolina). This is entirely optional but adds a good texture to the khaman. Skip rava or semolina for a gluten-free option.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stir with a whisk to create a smooth, thick batter without any lumps.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The batter should be thick yet flow easily off of the whisk. A quick tip is that if the batter becomes thin, then 1 to 2 tablespoons of gram flour.</p>
                <p>Next bring 2 to 2.5 cups of water to a boil in a steamer pan or electric cooker or pressure cooker. The amount of water to be added depends on the size of the steamer or pressure cooker.</p>
                <p><b>NOTE</b>: To know more about the steaming in a pan, cooker and Instant Pot in detail, do read the tips section below.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next add 2 teaspoons Eno or fruit salt. 2 teaspoons of Eno makes the khaman soft and fluffy. But there is a slightly alkaline taste to Eno.</p>
                <p>If you’re not a fan of this flavor then add only 1.5 teaspoons of Eno. If using baking soda as your leavening agent add ½ teaspoon to ¾ teaspoon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stir the eno with the batter briskly and quickly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The fruit salt should be mixed evenly with the batter or else you get uneven texture in the khaman.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The eno will make the batter become frothy, so you need to work quickly to whisk it in thoroughly.</p>
                <p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pour the prepared batter into the greased pan.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Gently shake so that the batter evens out in the pan. Below is a picture of the batter ready to be steamed.</p>

        <h2>Steaming</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Place the pan in a steamer or electric rice cooker or pressure cooker. The water should already be boiling or hot when you place the pan with the khaman batter. When using a pressure cooker, remove the vent weight/whistle from the lid and cover the cooker tightly with its lid.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/khamandhokla_steampan.png" style="width: 315px;height: 205px;" />
                    <br />
                    <br /><b>NOTE</b>: I have listed the detailed directions of steaming in a pan, pressure cooker and Instant pot in the tips sections below.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Steam for 15 to 20 minutes in an electric rice cooker. If using a pan or pressure cooker or Instant Pot, steam for 12 to 15 minutes on a medium to medium-high heat. In the below photo the khaman is cooked for 17 minutes using an electric rice cooker. <br /><br />You can begin working on the spice and herb solution for <b>tempering the khaman</b> while it cooks.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To check the doneness, insert a toothpick. It should come out clean if the khaman is done. If the toothpick has the batter on it, then you need to steam for another minutes or so.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Let the khaman become warm or cool completely. Gently slide a butter knife along the edges to release the khaman from the pan. Place a plate or tray on top of the pan.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Then quickly invert the pan.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If greased well, the khaman will easily slide out onto the plate.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use a sharp knife to slice the khaman in and <b>set aside until ready to temper</b>. Since I used a concave plate, the khaman settled down in the center. This won’t happen if you use a flat plate.</p>

        <h2>Preparing Tempering</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Tempering is essential to infuse the khaman with flavor and add moisture to the gram flour sponge. To make the temper, first heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a small pan on the stove. Use peanut oil or any neutral-tasting oil.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add 1 teaspoon of mustard seeds and allow them to crackle.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the mustard seeds are crackling, add 10 to 12 curry leaves, and, if you like, 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and 1 teaspoon of chopped green chili.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/khamandhokla_curryleaves.png" style="width: 323px;height: 212px;" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stir and then add 2 teaspoon white sesame seeds.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fry the sesame seeds for some seconds. But don’t brown them to become bitter.</p>
                <p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next carefully add ⅓ cup of water. You can switch off the heat when adding water.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Then add 2 teaspoons of sugar.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stir and allow the tempering mixture to come to a boil. Make sure that the sugar is dissolved.</p>

        <h2>Making Khaman</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Remove from the heat and immediately pour this tempering mixture evenly on the khaman dhokla so that it seeps through the sliced edges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Garnish with 2 to 3 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves and 2 to 3 tablespoons grated coconut, if you like.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/khamandhokla_gournishing.png" style="width: 340px;height: 226px;" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
        <p><b>Serve the khaman dhokla straight away</b> or you can store it in an airtight box and serve later after an hour. If enjoying khaman later after several hours, then don’t add coconut until ready to eat.</p>
        <p>You can also refrigerate them, and then when ready to serve just sprinkle some water and heat in a microwave for a few seconds until just warmed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/khamandhokla_serve.png" style="width: 309px;height: 348px;" />
        </p>
        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p>If you plan to serve khaman after a few hours or next day, then I do not recommend to add coconut or coriander. Simply pour the tempering.</p>
        <p>Refrigerate the khaman in a covered container. While serving you can warm with a sprinkling of water in a microwave or an oven.</p>
        <p>If using the instant pot to warm, then steam for 1 to 2 minutes. While serving add the coconut and coriander leaves.</p>
        <p>The sweet, savory, fluffy cakes pair great with our usual assortment of Indian chutneys like Papaya Chutney, Mint Chutney, or even Coriander Chutney.</p>
        <h2>Expert Tips</h2>
        <h3>Batter Consistency</h3>
        <p>The batter consistency has to be flowing but thick to medium-thick. 1 cup water with 1.5 cups of gram flour, always gives me perfect results, but you can add a few tablespoons of water if your batter looks very thick. A super thick batter will make the khaman hard and dense. A thin batter won’t hold shape and will become a mess.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Steaming</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">You can steam khaman in a pan, stove-top pressure cooker, or in an Instant Pot. I list below in detail on steaming khaman in each.</p>
