        <h2>What is Misal Pav?</h2>
        <p>“<b>Misal</b>” is a spicy sprouted bean curry also known as <b>“matkichi usal”</b> and <b>“Pav”</b> are buns or dinner rolls. The misal curry is garnished with fresh onions, cilantro, and farsan and served with warm buttery rolls.</p>
        <p><b>Farsan</b> is a crispy and flavourful snack that is also used as a garnish in chat and Indian breakfast dishes. The beans used in this recipe are called Math or Moth translated in English as Turkish or Dew beans</p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/nupparwad/OneDrive - CHR Solutions, Inc/Documents/Indian Food/Output/NUpparwad/Temporary/PDF/PDF_28255D51/Resources/Images/misalpav_ingredients.png" style="width: 256px;height: 234px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Served as a <b>hearty breakfast</b> in small street-side restaurants in Western India, Misal pav is extremely well-loved street food. It is always an instant hit at potlucks and gatherings. For me, it is a hearty meal that can be enjoyed any time of the day!</p>
        <p>The sprouted math/moth bean curry is simmered in a thin gravy known as “kat” or “rassa” with authentic flavors being induced by the freshly ground ginger, garlic, and a warming spice blend called <b>misal masala</b>. Misal masala is available at Indian grocery stores, but I use my own homemade spice mix as I love the intense flavors of freshly ground spices.</p>
        <p>

        <h2>Origins of Misal Pav</h2>
        <p>While the dish traces its origins to Nashik in Western India, over time, locals have tweaked the basic recipe of how to make misal, to suit their palettes. <b>Puneri Misal, Nagpuri Misal, Kolhapuri Misal, Nashik Misal, Khandeshi Misal</b> are some of the variants of this immensely popular dish.</p>
        <p>My mother always whipped up this spicy dish on dull rainy days and it never failed to lift up our dampened spirits. As the <b>matki usal</b> simmered away in an incredible combination of fresh ground ginger, garlic, coconut, and misal masala, our kitchen would come alive with many delightful aromas.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the condiments of diced onions, tomatoes, cilantro, lemon wedges, and crispy farsan placed neatly in small white bowls made for a visual delight. I remember us all waiting in cheerful anticipation as the misal cooked to sublime perfection.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>I often make misal pav for easy protein-packed weeknight meals. This steaming wholesome dish leaves us completely satiated and instantly transports me back down memory lane to my home in India.</p>
        <h3>How to Sprout Moth Beans</h3>
        <p>Sprouting beans at home is easy, it just needs a little bit of planning. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Rinse</b> 1 cup moth beans and soak in 3 cups of warm filter water for 8 hours or overnight.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Drain</b> Drain the water with a colander, wire mesh basket, or silicone basket making sure all the water is drained out.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Then place the basket in the Instant Pot, close the lid, and set the Instant Pot to <b>Yogurt mode</b> for 24 to 36 hours.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Curry’s Pro Tips for the best and authentic Misal Pav:</h2>
        <p><b>Vadilal brand frozen sprouted moth beans</b> are available in most Indian grocery stores. They come in handy when you do not have time to sprout the matki at home</p>
        <p>The traditional Misal recipe has lots of thin gravy also known as “<b>rassa</b>” or “<b>kat</b>” which is used to drench in the soft pillowy pav for each bite. Add more or less water depending on how much gravy you like. You can always add more hot water after the pressure cooking cycle has completed to thin out the gravy.</p>
        <p>Many people love a thin layer of oil known as “<b>Tarri</b>” or “<b>Tavang</b>” on the gravy. Oil called for in this recipe is on the medium side, but feel free to add more or less. Adding more oil will have a layer of the “tarri” to the final dish.</p>
        <p>I love using my <a href="https://ministryofcurry.com/moms-garam-masala/">mom’s garam masala</a> in this recipe and I use 2 tablespoons in this recipe. Any <a href="https://ministryofcurry.com/homemade-garam-masala-2/">Garam masala</a> will work in this recipe, start with 1 teaspoon and adjust as per your taste. You can also use store-bought Misal Masala, start with 1 tablespoon as it tends to be on the spicier side, and add more as needed.</p>
        <h2>Variations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Substitute half of the sprouted moth beans with mung beans.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>You can skip the green chilies to make the curry mild or add more for a spicier curry.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>You can add only 2 cups of water while pressure cooking the beans and then add warm water as needed to bring the curry to your desired consistency.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Although, sprouted beans are traditionally used in this recipe, in a pinch you can use soaked and un-sprouted beans. Use same pressure cooking time for soaked beans. To use dry moth beans increase the pressure cooking time to 15 minutes.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here is my Step by step recipe to make Maharashtrian Misal Pav:</p>
        <p><b>Step 1</b> – Blend tomato, chilies, ginger, garlic, and coconut in a blender to make a smooth paste (photos 1 – 2).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/nupparwad/OneDrive - CHR Solutions, Inc/Documents/Indian Food/Output/NUpparwad/Temporary/PDF/PDF_28255D51/Resources/Images/misalpav_variations.png" style="width: 283px;height: 140px;" />
        </p>
        <p><b>Step 2</b> – Set the Instant Pot to saute mode and heat oil. Add mustard seeds and allow them to pop. This may take 2 to 3 minutes. Add hing, turmeric, curry leaves, 1/4 cup cilantro, and onions. Saute everything as the onions start to turn translucent, it may take around 3 to 4 minutes. Cook covered to speed up the process (photos 3 – 6).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/nupparwad/OneDrive - CHR Solutions, Inc/Documents/Indian Food/Output/NUpparwad/Temporary/PDF/PDF_28255D51/Resources/Images/misalpav_variations2.png" style="width: 262px;height: 235px;" />
        </p>
        <p><b>Step 3</b> – Next, stir in the spice paste and saute for another minute. Add red chili powder, ground coriander, garam masala, ground cumin, and salt. Mix well. Add sprouted beans and mix well. Add water and give a quick stir. Secure the Instant Pot with the pressure valve to sealing. Pressure Cook (Hi) for 5 minutes followed by 10-minute natural pressure release (photos 7 – 10).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/nupparwad/OneDrive - CHR Solutions, Inc/Documents/Indian Food/Output/NUpparwad/Temporary/PDF/PDF_28255D51/Resources/Images/misalpav_variations3.png" style="width: 273px;height: 250px;" />
        </p>
        <p><b>Step 4</b> – Release the remaining pressure by turning the pressure release valve to venting. Open the lid and give a quick stir. Garnish with remaining cilantro (photos 11 – 12).</p>

        <h2>How to Serve Misal Pav?</h2>
        <p>Heat a nonstick griddle or pan. Lightly spread butter or ghee on each half of the bun/pav and place them on the pan. Gently pressing them down with a spatula cook both sides until they are heated through. <b>Serve hot pav alongside the misal topped with farsan, red onions, and cilantro</b>. Here is a tip, serve the farsan on the side so it stays crunchy. I like to serve plain yogurt on the side along with lemon wedges.</p>
        <p>To serve this dish as a <b>gluten-free option</b>, simply add lots of diced onion, tomatoes, farsan, and few spoonfuls of plain yogurt over the curry and enjoy with a squeeze of fresh lemon or serve it over steamed rice for a complete meal.</p>
